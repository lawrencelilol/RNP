**Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)** provides the quickest way to enter data in a calculator because it eliminates the need for parenthesis. It was made mainstream by HP when they implemented it in their famous programmable calculators. It is also very simple to code into a computer program. This is a simple online RPN calculator for you to try out. It's written in Javascript


**How to use it**

Unlike with a traditional calculator, you enter the parameters first, than the operator.

For example, to calculate '20+50': type '20' -> Press â†‘ -> '50' -> Press '+'
